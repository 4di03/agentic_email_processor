I have a busy inbox. Below are some emails I've received recently:
{emails}

Please summarize only the relevant emails. I don't care about:
- Spam or promotional emails
- Newsletters
- Social media notifications
- articles or blog posts

For EACH relevant email, provide the the subject, summary, and your own label for is_important (boolean), after making your judgmenet based on the following criteria:


Remember to include such a structured json object if the email is one of the following:
- Emails from colleagues or clients or work-related
- emails directly from a person, not automated or a company
- important updates or alerts
- meeting requests or calendar invites

If there are no relevant emails, simply respond with an empty list. To be 100% clear, the output should be a list of JSON objects, one per relevant email. 

The entire output MUST be a valid JSON array.
