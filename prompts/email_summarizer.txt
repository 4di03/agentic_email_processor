I have a busy inbox. Below are some emails I've received recently:
{emails}

Please summarize only the relevant emails. I don't care about:
- Spam or promotional emails
- Newsletters
- Social media notifications
- articles or blog posts

I care MOST about emails that require my attention or action, such as:
- Emails from colleagues or clients or work-related
- emails directly from a person, not automated or a company
- important updates or alerts
- meeting requests or calendar invites

For each relevant email, provide:
1. A brief summary of the email content, and any action items if present (2-3 sentences)
2. the subject of the email so that i can easily identify it later

If there are no relevant emails, simply respond with "No relevant emails."
Include ONLY the summary or the above text in the response, nothing else.
